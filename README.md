# Project Four: Dogs API Gallery

For Project Four we used the [Dogs API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to create an interactive webpage, where the user is able to enter a breed of dog and receive six random images of that breed. 

## Deployment

As part of this project, we deployed our web app to Github.
